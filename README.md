# Dawson's Water Reminder

**Dawson's Water Reminder** is a simple yet effective desktop application designed to remind users to stay hydrated throughout the day. Built with Python, the app uses `customtkinter` for the user interface, `pygame` for sound management, and offers a system tray integration for minimized operation. It includes features like automatic startup on Windows boot, customizable reminder intervals, and sound selection.

## Key Features:
- **Customizable Reminder Intervals**: Set the frequency of reminders in minutes.
- **Sound Notifications**: Choose a custom sound to play at each reminder.
- **System Tray Integration**: Minimize the app to the system tray for convenient background operation.
- **Autostart with Windows**: Option to enable or disable the app to start automatically when Windows boots.
- **Audio Device Change Handling**: Automatically adjusts when the audio device is changed.
- **Configurable Settings**: Save and load user settings such as volume, reminder interval, and sound file.
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, with future potential for cross-platform compatibility.

## Libraries Used:
- `customtkinter`: A custom version of Tkinter for modern UI elements.
- `pygame`: For sound playback functionality.
- `pystray`: To create a system tray icon with options for app control.
- `ctypes`, `comtypes`: For handling Windows-specific APIs such as detecting audio device changes.
- `winreg`: For managing the Windows registry for autostart functionality.
- `configparser`: For storing and loading user settings from a configuration file.

## How It Works:
- The app runs as a background process, reminding you to drink water at regular intervals.
- It includes an interactive interface for selecting sound files, adjusting the volume, and setting the reminder interval.
- It can be minimized to the system tray and continues to run quietly in the background.
- On detecting an audio device change (such as switching from speakers to headphones), the app automatically reinitializes the sound system to ensure proper playback.
- The app is fully configurable and saves settings such as the reminder interval, sound file, volume, and autostart preference.
